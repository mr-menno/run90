            Description:
            ${{ github.event.issue.body }}

            Read the codebase and create a plan that includes:
            1. Files that need to be created or modified
            2. Specific changes required in each file
            3. Testing approach
            4. Any risks or trade-offs

            Format the plan clearly with markdown. Do NOT make any code changes.
